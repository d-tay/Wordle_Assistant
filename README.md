# Wordle_Assistant
A python script that takes user input based off guesses to the game Wordle, and presents the user with possible answers.

A very simple script that takes user input about orange, green, and grey letters and their positions.
Not really meant to "cheat" at Wordle per se, but was more of a project I thought would be mildly interesting.
